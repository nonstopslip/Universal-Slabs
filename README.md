# Universal-Slabs
A simple mod that makes all slabs placeable vertically as well as horizontally.

While this mod aims to work with other mods that add slabs, it is not guaranteed that all features, especially the block models, work as expected.

To fix block models manually, add a resource pack that contains assets/minecraft/blockstates and add any not_working_slab.json. Copy any slab json from this repository's src/main/generated/assets/minecraft/blockstates and adjust the "model" specifications of the not working blockstates.
